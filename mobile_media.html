        <p class="subheading">As part of the Mobile Media project, I created a new software that facilitates social contacts through sports for individuals relocating abroad. The idea was inspired by the example of a New Zealand women's football team.
           To assess current solutions, a competitive study was conducted before the project began. Brainstorming and the definition of the app's primary features came next. Using these findings, I developed a user experience that shows how a new user could use the app to connect with others and locate an appropriate sports club.
           In order to envision the app's structure and navigation, I then created a storyboard, flowchart, and hand-drawn sketches. Wireflow and a menu structure were created to provide a smooth user experience.During the design stage, I produced preliminary mock-ups and a style guide that established the app's visual identity and branding. Finally, I created a mock-up flow and a clickable prototype in Figma so that the user journey could be interactively demonstrated.

           Using this methodical process, I created a thoughtful, user-focused app design that promotes social connection via sports.</p>
