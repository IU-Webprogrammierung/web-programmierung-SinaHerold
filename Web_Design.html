        <h2>Körnig: Creating an Organic Juice and Smoothie Shop Website</h2>

        <p class="subheading">The goal of this project was to create a responsive website for Körnig, a fictitious organic business that sells juice and smoothies in the center of Würzburg. The objective was to develop a contemporary and captivating online presence that emphasizes the store's dedication to organic products and its status as a family-owned enterprise.

            <br>There were three stages to the project:
            <br>✔ Concept Phase: The main idea is developed, personas are created, a sitemap is created, and interactive wireframes are created to specify the structure of the website.
            <br>✔ Design Phase: Investigation of several design variants, encompassing color schemes, typography, and logo development. Clear user instructions and contemporary aesthetics played a major role in the final design's selection.
            <br>✔ Finalization Phase: Making adjustments to the button sizes, spacing, and interactive components for both desktop and mobile versions. Figma Mirror testing is used to ensure usability.
            
            <br>The project gave me important knowledge about responsive web design, user-centered development, and UI/UX design. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn how to balance style and utility.</p>
