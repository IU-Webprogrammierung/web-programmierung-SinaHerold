                 <p  class="subheading">Web-Design <br>My task was building a website for a shop named "KÃ¶rnig". They sold smoothies and juices. Goal was to present a website with 4 sites and to build it from scratch. </p>
          
                 <p class="subheading 2">Mobile Media <br>As part of the Mobile Media project, I created a new software that facilitates social contacts through sports for individuals relocating abroad. The idea was inspired by the example of a New Zealand women's football team.
                    To assess current solutions, a competitive study was conducted before the project began. Brainstorming and the definition of the app's primary features came next. Using these findings, I developed a user experience that shows how a new user could use the app to connect with others and locate an appropriate sports club.
                    In order to envision the app's structure and navigation, I then created a storyboard, flowchart, and hand-drawn sketches. Wireflow and a menu structure were created to provide a smooth user experience.During the design stage, I produced preliminary mock-ups and a style guide that established the app's visual identity and branding. Finally, I created a mock-up flow and a clickable prototype in Figma so that the user journey could be interactively demonstrated.

                    Using this methodical process, I created a thoughtful, user-focused app design that promotes social connection via sports.</p>
